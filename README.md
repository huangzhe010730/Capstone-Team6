This repository is part of a project that aims to demonstrate best practices in writing clean, well-documented code for complex statistical and machine learning analyses. Our objective is to create a publicly accessible, open-source guide that others can reference and adapt for their own work.

We use the HIPM (Health Insurance Poverty Measure) dataset as a case study to walk through each step of a typical data analysis pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and reporting. The focus of this project is not only on the insights generated by the analysis, but also on **how to write code that is clear, consistent, modular, and reproducible.
